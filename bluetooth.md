To play sound through a Bluetooth speaker on a Raspberry Pi, you'll need to pair and connect the Bluetooth speaker, then configure the Raspberry Pi to use the Bluetooth speaker as the default audio output device. Here’s how to do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Bluetooth Utilities:**
   Ensure that the necessary Bluetooth packages are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez blueman pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth pavucontrol
   ```

2. **Start Bluetooth Services:**
   Ensure that the Bluetooth services are running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start bluetooth
   sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
   ```

3. **Pair and Connect the Bluetooth Speaker:**

   - **Using Command Line:**
     ```bash
     bluetoothctl
     ```
     - Enter the Bluetooth control tool.
     - Turn on the Bluetooth agent:
       ```
       agent on
       ```
     - Set the agent as default:
       ```
       default-agent
       ```
     - Scan for devices:
       ```
       scan on
       ```
     - Note the MAC address of your Bluetooth speaker from the list of found devices.
     - Pair with the device (replace `<MAC_ADDRESS>` with the actual MAC address of your Bluetooth speaker):
       ```
       pair <MAC_ADDRESS>
       ```
     - Connect to the device:
       ```
       connect <MAC_ADDRESS>
       ```
     - Trust the device to allow automatic connection in the future:
       ```
       trust <MAC_ADDRESS>
       ```
     - Exit the Bluetooth control tool:
       ```
       exit
       ```

4. **Set Bluetooth Speaker as Default Audio Output:**

   - **Using PulseAudio Volume Control:**
     ```bash
     pavucontrol
     ```
     - Open the PulseAudio Volume Control interface.
     - Go to the “Output Devices” tab and set the Bluetooth speaker as the fallback device.

   - **Using Command Line:**
     Edit the PulseAudio configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa
     ```
     Add or uncomment the following lines:
     ```
     load-module module-bluetooth-policy
     load-module module-bluetooth-discover
     ```
     Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

5. **Restart PulseAudio:**
   Restart the PulseAudio service to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   pulseaudio --kill
   pulseaudio --start
   ```

6. **Test the Audio Output:**
   Test if the audio output is working through the Bluetooth speaker:
   ```bash
   aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
   ```

### Updating the Python Script to Use the Bluetooth Speaker

The `pygame` library should automatically use the default audio output device set by PulseAudio, which will now be your Bluetooth speaker. Therefore, no changes to the Python script are needed.

### Summary

1. Install necessary Bluetooth and audio packages.
2. Start and enable Bluetooth services.
3. Pair and connect your Bluetooth speaker using `bluetoothctl`.
4. Set the Bluetooth speaker as the default audio output device using `pavucontrol` or by editing the PulseAudio configuration file.
5. Restart PulseAudio to apply the changes.
6. Test the audio output.
